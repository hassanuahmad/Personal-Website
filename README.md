# Personal Website
This is my personal website which I made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and PHP.

In order to make the contact form functional, you have to download the PHPMailer repository from https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer and save the following 3 files into a folder named PHPMailer in the source folder:

- Exception.php
- PHPMailer.php
- SMTP.php

Enjoy!
